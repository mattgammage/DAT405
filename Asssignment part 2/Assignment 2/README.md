Assignment Part 2 DAT405

For the second half of the assignment, my work contains coding that changes the colour shade of one of four thermometers on the canvas to either a brighter shade or a darker shade, depending on the data from the website that is linked in with my coding.

For example, the first thermometer on the left of the page will change shades of blue because I decided to have the temperature of places linked to this code. Meaning that if a the temperature is really high, then the shade of blue will be brighter, or if it the temperature is really low then it will become darker, even become black if it is low enough.

I wanted to try adding some more specific designs to the overall code, however no matter how many times I tried, I was unable to incorporate them into my work unfortunately.
