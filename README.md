Assignment DAT405
My work contains specific coding so that once the page is either brought up or refreshed a circle would descend from the top left side of the background it was on to the bottom right, while leaving afterimages behind it.

The code contained was created so that at the beginning when the shape moves, the background would change from light grey to dark grey. There is also specific coding involved which randomises the colour of the shape and the afterimages as well.
